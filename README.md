##Editorial guidelines:##

###Markup tips###

Ids should go on section elements, not `hx` elements.

```
<section id="h_my_heading">
<h2>My heading</h2>
```

Ids on `dfn` elements should start with `def_`.

Use the following markup for Unicode codepoint names:

```
<span class="uname">U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP</span> [ã€‚]
```
